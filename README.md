<a name="usage"/>

## Usage

This project could be used to store, update, delete and display inventory information for a small business or office. The application takes JSON via Insomnia. Using the JSON and corresponding routes to the api on Insomnia; mySQL data is generated, stored, updated, and deleted in the corresponding database and tables.

Once all necessary files are cloned and the package dependencies are installed, the user can run a command of "npm run seeds" in the terminal to create the starter data in the database. After this, the user can use a command of "npm run dev" or "npm start" to begin listening on the corresponding PORT.

From there Insomnia will be the main interface for interacting with the database.
